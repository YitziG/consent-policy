## How to Make Your Project GDPR Compliant

Our legal team requires us to ensure that all new and existing projects are fully [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) compliant.

A big part of being GDPR compliant is getting explicit user permission when creating or accessing information that could potentially be used to identify or track users.

For specific categories of user information (i.e., Cookies), permission needs to be requested from the user at runtime, before we can execute the "sensitive" code.

Therefore, it is crucial to have a clear picture of exactly which categories of permissions your app will need to request so that you can do so in the right place and at the right time.

### Big Picture

To make this transition as painless as possible, we provide a small javascript library that you can include in your app's header or in any location where you are pulling in external scripts(i.e., main.js).

Using this library, you can get a boolean flag map from the server that describes precisely which permissions your app must request. 

Using [EJS](https://ejs.co) or any other templating language or framework, you can bind those values to DOM elements displaying and hiding permission requests as appropriate.

### Integration

The first step is to include our script in your project header (or wherever you pull in external scripts).

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Awesome Wix Integration!</title>
  <!-- Here is a good place for our script tag -->
  <script src="https://static.parastorage.com/services/consent-policy-client/1.0.0/app.bundle.js"></script>
</head>

<body>  
  <p>Hello world! This is our teams integration.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Tip:** If you are sure that your project doesn't need to request permissions until after the page finishes loading, you can include our script tag at the end of your `<body>` for a faster page load.
  
```html
<body>  
  <p>Hello world! This is our teams integration.</p>
  <script src="https://static.parastorage.com/services/consent-policy-client/1.0.0/app.bundle.js"></script>
</body>
```

Once the page finishes loading you can initialize the library provided "consent policy" object with the live data from the server like so: 
```javascript
consentPolicy.init(policy);
```

You can access the flag map with:
```javascript
consentPolicy.categories
```

To visualize this you can type `consentPolicy.categories` in the console, and you will get something like this:
```json
{
  marketing: false, 
  logging: false, 
  stability: true
};
```

It is now trivial to bind relevant parts of your policy to the appropriate fields on this object!

```html
<p>Please grant the following required permissions:</p>

<% if (consentPolicy.categories.marketing) { %>
<div>
  <input type="checkbox" id="marketing" name="marketing"
         checked>
  <label for="marketing">Marketing</label>
</div>
<% } %>
  
<% if (consentPolicy.categories.logging) { %>
<div>
  <input type="checkbox" id="logging" name="logging">
  <label for="logging">Logging</label>
</div>
<% } %>

<% if (consentPolicy.categories.stability) { %>
<div>
  <input type="checkbox" id="stability" name="stability">
  <label for="stability">Stability</label>
</div>
<% } %>
```

Using the example map from above the rendered HTML would look like so:
```html
<p>Please grant the following required permissions:</p>

<div>
  <input type="checkbox" id="stability" name="stability">
  <label for="stability">Stability</label>
</div>
```
And in the browser like so:

Please grant the following required permissions:

- [ ]  Stability

### Real-time Permission Checks

Now that you are requesting the appropriate permissions, you are going to want to make sure that the user has indeed granted the necessary consent before you store any identifying data in the user's browser or on Wix servers. We provide an easy way to do that inside our ["data-capsule"](https://github.com/wix/data-capsule) library.

The data capsule library is a neat and easy way to store key/value data for your application. You can use it to store data on the user's browsers local storage as well as on Wix servers.

First use your package manager (we recommend NPM) to install the ["data-capsule"](https://github.com/wix/data-capsule) package. 
```shell
npm install --save data-capsule
```

In the past (before GDPR) setting a browser cookie was as simple as:
```javascript
import {LocalStorageCapsule} from 'data-capsule';

const capsule = LocalStorageCapsule({namespace: '${your-app-namespace}'});
await capsule.setItem('shahata', 123);
```

Now to be GDPR compliant, we need to wrap that code in a try/catch that will prevent the execution of the sensitive code if the user has not granted us the required permission.

We will also want to handle that situation gracefully by requesting the permission again or with some other appropriate flow.

Here are the changes you will need to make:

1. On the top line, add COOKIE_CONTENT_DISALLOWED to your import
```javascript
import { LocalStorageCapsule, COOKIE_CONSENT_DISALLOWED } from 'data-capsule';
```
2. Pass the cookie category along with the cookie in `capsule.setItem()
```javascript
await capsule.setItem('shahata', 123, { category: 'advertising' });
```
This code will throw a `COOKIE_CONTENT_DISSALOWED` error if the user has not granted the appropriate permission.

Therefore, this line needs to be wrapped in a try/catch block and handled appropriately.

Your code should now look something like this:
```javascript
import { LocalStorageCapsule, COOKIE_CONSENT_DISALLOWED } from 'data-capsule';

const capsule = LocalStorageCapsule({namespace: '${your-app-namespace}'});

try {
  await capsule.setItem('shahata', 123, { category: 'advertising' });
} catch (e) {
  if (e === COOKIE_CONSENT_DISALLOWED) {
    requestPermission()
  } else {
    displayErrorMessage()
  }
}
```

### Logging Permission Requests, Responses, and Issues
Since requesting and setting permissions at runtime can be complicated and brings a new layer of dynamic branching to your application, it is vital to log app interactions and flow.

The easiest way to do this is with the Wix [bi-logger](https://github.com/shahata/shahata.github.io/blob/master/sudoku-solver/bower_components/wix-bi-logger/README.md) package.

Once again:
```bash
npm install --save wix-bi-logger
```

And at the top of the relevant class:
```javascript
import logger from `wix-bi-logger`
```
You can now log all relevant events and errors with:
`logger.log(event, category);` and `logger.error(event, category);`

Using our previous example, you might do something like this:
```javascript
import { LocalStorageCapsule, COOKIE_CONSENT_DISALLOWED } from 'data-capsule';
import logger from `wix-bi-logger`

const capsule = LocalStorageCapsule({namespace: '${your-app-namespace}'});

try {
  await capsule.setItem('shahata', 123, { category: 'advertising' });
} catch (e) {
  if (e === COOKIE_CONSENT_DISALLOWED) {    
    requestPermission()
    logger.log('REQUESTED_PERMISSION', 'advertising');
  } else {
    displayErrorMessage()
    logger.error('COOKIE_SETTING_FAILED', '$classname');
  }
}
```

That's all there is to it! You should now understand how to request and check for permissions in your app dynamically!

### A Word of Caution
This process is at an experimental stage, so you are going to want a way to bypass all of this so that you can work on your project without having to make sure the entire permissions pipeline is working.

We recommend wrapping all the permission dependant conditional logic in an `if` statement.

```javascript
If(gdprEnforced){
//Run the conditional stuff here
}else{
//Do your regular stuff
}
```

This way, when working on other parts of your app, you can set `gdprEnforced = false`, remember to flip it back to  `true` and make sure everything runs smoothly before deploying!
